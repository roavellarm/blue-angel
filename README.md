## **Description**

This work presents the development of an application that seeks to make the practice of literacy of autistic children with learning difficulties feasible. The project aims to help children with autism, through a mobile app, in the first school steps, when they may have more difficulties, due to the limitations that Autism Spectrum Disorder can offer. It is hoped that, through application, children will be able to fully develop in their literacy.
